# Overview

In this project I focused on analyzing various statistics from players and teams that participated in the 2023-2024 NBA playoffs. This information can be applicable to NBA coaches and managers because I anaylzed statistics that correlate with higher success within the games. Using the correlations and patterns that I determined from my proccessing NBA executives can use this information to create the best teams and lineups possible that give them the highest probabilty of winning games. 

## Data Cleaning

Looking at the raw dataset that I chose to use I found that there was no duplicates or missing/null values within the data. The only thing I recognized that was incorrect with this dataset is that a few of the player names were spelled incorrectly so I just edited those to be correct.

## Questions

There were 4 questions that I anaylzed through my research. These questions are: how does minutes per game correlate with points per game, how does player age correlate with points per game, how does scoring efficiency change with points per game, and what is the relationship between 2 point shot percentage and 3 point shot percentage.



In this repository there is also a link to the file I created visuals and anaylzed data with which can be accessed by clicking the "capstone.pbix" file and accessing it through Power BI. There is also a link to the google sheet file I used to analyze data as well as a link to the raw dataset that I used with this project.
