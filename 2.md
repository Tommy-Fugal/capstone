This graph shows us a correlation between 2 point percentage and 3 point percentage with the dark blue line representing 3p% and the light blue line representing 2P%. Looking at the graph we can determine that there is no visual correlation between 2P% and 3P% and there is no noticable pattern. Something to be noted is that the higher scorers maintain a steadier 2 point percentage but their 3 point percentage doesnâ€™t increase accordingly which we can infer that this means that the higher point per game scorers either rely more on efficient 2 pointers or high volume from the 3 point line. This information can prove useful to NBA coaches and managers because it gives them an insight of typically how efficient certain ranges of scorers are and what specifically they rely on for the majority of their points.
