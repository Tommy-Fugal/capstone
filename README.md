In this project I focused on analyzing various statistics from players and teams that participated in the 2023-2024 NBA playoffs. This information can be applicable to NBA coaches and managers because I anaylzed statistics that correlate with higher success within the games. Using the correlations and patterns that I determined from my proccessing NBA executives can use this information to create the best teams and lineups possible that give them the highest probabilty of winning games. There were 4 questions/correlations that I anaylzed through my research. These questions are: how does minutes per game correlate with points per game, how does player age correlate with points per game, how does scoring efficiency correlate with points per game, and what is the correlation between 2 point shot percentage and 3 point shot percentage.

Looking at this repository there are 4 main tabs that give the answers to these questions as long as a final conclusion. 
"1": How does age correlate with points per game
"2": Correlation between 2 point percentage and 3 point percentage
"3": How does minutes per game correlate with points per game
"4": How does scoring efficieny correlate with points per game

In this repository there is also a link to the file I created visuals and anaylzed data with which can be accessed by clicking the "capstone.pbix" file and accessing it through Power BI. There is also a link to the google sheet file I used to analyze data as well as a link to the raw dataset that I used with this project.
