Looking at this chart we can see how efficieny correlates with points per game. The dark blue line represents the players field goal percentage and as you scroll down the chart it shows the players sorted by points per game descending. There is not really a trend between efficiency and points per game. Every player that averaged 20+ points per game scored with an efficiency between 40-63% which shows that typically a high scorer will average around 50% of their shots going in. However when you look at players who averaged less than 10 points per game there is a way higher range which is 0-100% which just shows that players who average less points are just more hit and miss with their total efficiency. This information can be useful to NBA coaches and managers because it shows them and gives them an idea of how efficient certain players should be so if a player does not live up to this expectation they can infer they should play them less minutes.
