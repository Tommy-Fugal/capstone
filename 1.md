This picture shows a graph showing the correlation between age and points per game. My hypothesis before creating this visual was that a majority of the highest scorers would be between the ages of 25-30 because this is typically when a player would be in their prime hence this is where I predicted the best players to fall under. After creating this visual I noticed that there really is not a correlation at all between age and points per game and my hypothesis seemed to be false. The 2 things that stood out to me most on this chart was that every player under the age of 20 scored under 10 points per game as well as every player over 35 scored under 15 besides one outlier. Other than that there is really no pattern or correlation between points per game and age which tells us that there is no reason to consider age when determining and predicting whether a player will be a higher scorer or not.
